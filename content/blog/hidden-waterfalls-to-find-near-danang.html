<p>Before you embark on your quest for these stunning cascades, some preparation is key. The best time to visit Danang&#8217;s waterfalls is generally during the rainy season (September to December) or just after, when the water flow is strongest, though trails can be muddy. Always wear sturdy, waterproof hiking shoes and bring swimwear, a towel, plenty of water, and snacks. Safety first: inform someone of your plans and estimated return time.
