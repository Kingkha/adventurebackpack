<p>The best months to visit Quito are from <strong>June to September</strong>, coinciding with the dry season. During this period, you can expect clear skies and sunshine, making it ideal for outdoor activities, such as hiking and exploring the city. <em>However, it’s worth noting that Quito’s weather can be unpredictable!</em> Even in the dry season, it’s essential to pack a light jacket for the cooler evenings and occasional rain showers.</p>

<li><strong>Lower Prices:</strong> Traveling during the shoulder season can lead to discounts on accommodations and activities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Important Considerations</h3>
<p>Regardless of when you plan to travel, here are some <strong>key considerations</strong>:</p>
