<p>Proper preparation is paramount for a successful and safe Mount Yotei hike. Always pack layers; even on a warm summer day, the weather near the summit can change rapidly. Sturdy hiking boots, sufficient water (at least 2-3 liters), high-energy snacks, a headlamp, and a basic first-aid kit are non-negotiable. I always carry a rain jacket, regardless of the forecast – Hokkaido weather can be unpredictable!

<h2>Staying Safe on the Summit and Descent</h2>
