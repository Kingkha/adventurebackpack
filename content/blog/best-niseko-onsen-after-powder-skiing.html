<div data-gyg-partner-id="26CH4CT" data-gyg-widget="auto" loading="lazy"></div>
<p>To ensure a respectful and enjoyable onsen experience, there are a few etiquette tips you should know. First and foremost, always wash thoroughly before entering the bath. There are designated showering areas with soap and shampoo – scrub up well! Swimsuits are generally not permitted in traditional onsen; you enter nude. Don&#8217;t worry, everyone else is too! If you have tattoos, it&#8217;s wise to check the onsen&#8217;s policy beforehand, as some may require you to cover them. Being mindful of these customs is key to a smooth experience, akin to understanding safety protocols for <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/safest-niseko-solo-adventure-activities">safest Niseko solo adventure activities</a> or ensuring you have <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/essential-niseko-adventure-travel-insurance-tips">essential Niseko adventure travel insurance tips</a> covered.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Q: Can I go to an onsen with tattoos in Niseko?</h3>
<p>A: Many traditional Japanese onsen have strict no-tattoo policies, but Niseko is becoming more accommodating due to international visitors. Look for onsen marked as &#8216;tattoo-friendly&#8217; or inquire beforehand. Some may ask you to cover smaller tattoos with a patch. It&#8217;s always best to check directly with the specific onsen you plan to visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Q: Do I need to bring anything to a Niseko onsen?</h3>
<p>A: Most onsen provide small towels for modesty and drying, as well as shampoo and soap in the washing areas. However, it&#8217;s always a good idea to bring your own larger towel for drying off properly afterward. If you&#8217;re sensitive to certain products, you might also consider bringing your own toiletries. Otherwise, just bring your adventurous spirit!</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Q: Are Niseko onsen co-ed or separated?</h3>
<p>A: The vast majority of traditional Niseko onsen are gender-separated, with distinct bathing areas for men and women. Look for signs (typically red for women, blue for men). Some larger resorts or private onsen might offer mixed-gender options, but these usually require swimsuits. Always double-check if you&#8217;re unsure.</p>
