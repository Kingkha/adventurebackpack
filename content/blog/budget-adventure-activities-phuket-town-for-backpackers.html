<p>Phuket Town is surrounded by stunning natural landscapes perfect for those seeking outdoor thrills without spending a fortune. One of my favorite budget adventure activities is hiking up to the Big Buddha. It&#8217;s a challenging but rewarding trek, offering panoramic views of the island that are truly breathtaking.
