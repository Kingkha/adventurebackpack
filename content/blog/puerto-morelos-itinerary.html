<blockquote>
<p>“This is the season to bask in the sun, with pristine beaches and vibrant local festivities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is the most popular time to visit, be prepared for larger crowds and increased accommodation rates. Make your reservations well in advance to secure better rates and a choice of locations.</p>
<h3>Spring (March to May)</h3>
