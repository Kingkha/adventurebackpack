<p>Embarking on your Sagada caving tour starts with the journey from Baguio City, a scenic yet winding road trip that takes about 5-6 hours. Your primary option is catching a bus from the Slaughterhouse Compound terminal in Baguio. Look for GL Trans or Lizardo Trans buses heading directly to Sagada. My pro tip? Aim for an early morning departure; not only will you avoid traffic, but you’ll also arrive with plenty of daylight to settle in. This bus trip is an adventure in itself, offering breathtaking mountain views. It’s a crucial leg of your <strong>how to book Sagada caving tours from Baguio City</strong> plan, setting the stage for the spelunking thrill that awaits.

<h2>How to Book Sagada Caving Tours Locally</h2>
<p>Once you arrive in Sagada, booking your caving tour is surprisingly straightforward. Forget pre-booking online; the best way to secure your adventure is by heading straight to the Sagada Tourism Office. They are the official hub for all tours, connecting you with accredited local guides. You&#8217;ll find options for Sumaguing Cave (the popular &#8216;Big Cave&#8217;) or the more challenging Lumiang-Sumaguing Cave Connection, a full-on spelunking experience that requires crawling and squeezing through tight spots. My personal recommendation for adventure seekers is the connection; it&#8217;s truly unforgettable! Remember, this local booking process ensures you get legitimate tours and support the community. This step is key to effectively organizing your <strong>Sagada caving tours</strong> itinerary.</p>
<h2>Preparing for Your Sagada Caving Adventure</h2>

<p>Before you dive into the dark, damp, and thrilling world of Sagada&#8217;s caves, proper preparation is key. Wear sturdy sandals or shoes with good grip, as the cave floors can be slippery. Light, quick-drying clothes are best – expect to get wet and muddy, especially in the Lumiang-Sumaguing connection! You&#8217;ll also need a headlamp, though guides usually provide these along with helmets. Don&#8217;t forget a waterproof bag for your phone or camera. From my experience, bringing a small towel is a lifesaver for cleaning up afterwards.
