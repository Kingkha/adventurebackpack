<h2>Essential Tips for a Smooth First Snorkeling Experience</h2>
<p>To ensure your first time snorkeling is awesome, here are some tips. First, make sure your mask fits snugly without being too tight, and learn to clear it of water. Breathing through a snorkel feels unnatural at first, so practice in shallow water. Always use reef-safe sunscreen or wear a rash guard – the sun is intense, even underwater. Also, remember to float calmly and avoid touching or standing on coral; preserving these delicate ecosystems is crucial.
