However, you can find fantastic <strong>budget adventure activities in Tokyo for backpackers</strong> regardless of the season. Summer can be hot and humid, while winter is crisp and clear. Packing light but smart is key: comfortable walking shoes are non-negotiable. A reusable water bottle and a portable charger are also must-haves for long days of exploration.
