Nestled along the eastern coast of Bali, Padangbai is a picturesque harbor town known for its stunning beaches, vibrant marine life, and rich culture. To fully enjoy what this charming destination has to offer, you should consider the climate, local festivities, and peak tourist seasons.</p>
<p>During the year, Bali experiences two distinct seasons: the <strong>dry season</strong> and the <strong>wet season</strong>.
