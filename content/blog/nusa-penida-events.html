This special day, which usually falls in March, is a time for self-reflection and cleansing. The Balinese New Year is marked by total silence, when the island comes to a standstill, allowing both locals and visitors to observe the tranquility.</p>

This is symbolic of driving away evil spirits, paving the way for a peaceful new year.</p>
