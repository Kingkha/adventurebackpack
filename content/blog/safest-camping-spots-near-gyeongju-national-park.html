<p>While the allure of &#8216;wild camping&#8217; might be strong, it&#8217;s crucial to understand that setting up camp just anywhere in or around Gyeongju National Park is generally prohibited and unsafe. Unofficial or &#8216;free&#8217; camping spots lack supervision, sanitation, and often legal standing, making them far from the <strong>safest camping spots near Gyeongju National Park</strong>.
