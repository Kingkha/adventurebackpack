<p>Hiking in Nara is generally very safe, but being aware of a few things will enhance your experience. Trail markers are usually clear, but it’s always wise to have an offline map downloaded on your phone. Most importantly, Nara is famous for its wild deer.

From my travels, I&#8217;ve seen how quickly they can get assertive if you don&#8217;t follow the rules.
