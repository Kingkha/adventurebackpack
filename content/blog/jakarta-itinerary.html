<p>Planning your <strong>Jakarta itinerary</strong> requires a keen consideration of the climate and seasonal <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/jakarta-highlights/">Highlights</a>. Jakarta, being located near the equator, has a tropical climate, which means it experiences two primary seasons: wet and dry.</p>
<h3>Dry Season: April to October</h3>
<p>The <strong>dry season</strong> stretches from April to October, making it the best time to visit Jakarta. During these months, the weather is relatively stable with less rainfall, allowing for optimal exploration of the city’s outdoor <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/jakarta-landmarks/">attractions</a>.</p>
<p>One significant highlight of the dry season is the <strong>Jakarta Fair</strong>, traditionally held in June and July.

<h3>Wet Season: November to March</h3>
<p>From November to March, the city experiences its <strong>wet season</strong>, characterized by increased rainfall and humidity. Although visiting during this period might seem daunting, it also has its unique advantages.</p>
<p>Firstly, the rain typically falls in the afternoon, allowing you to enjoy your mornings exploring the city.
