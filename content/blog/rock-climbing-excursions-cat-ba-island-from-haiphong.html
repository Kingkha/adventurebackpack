<p>Your rock climbing adventure begins in Haiphong, a bustling city that serves as the perfect launchpad to Cat Ba Island. The most straightforward way to reach the island is via the ferry from Got Pier (Ben Pha Got). You can grab a local bus or a taxi from Haiphong city center to the pier, which takes about 45 minutes to an hour. The ferry ride itself is a scenic 20-30 minute journey across the bay, often accompanied by local fishing boats and stunning karst formations. It&#8217;s surprisingly affordable, making it a great budget-friendly start to your <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/haiphong-adventures">Haiphong adventures</a>. My personal tip? Aim for an early morning ferry to beat the crowds and maximize your climbing day!</p>
<h2>Essential Gear and Safety for Your Climb</h2>
<p>Before you hit those vertical walls, ensuring you have the right gear and prioritize safety is paramount. While most organized rock climbing excursions on Cat Ba Island will provide the necessary technical equipment like harnesses, ropes, and climbing shoes, it&#8217;s always wise to double-check. I always recommend bringing your own chalk bag if you have one, as well as plenty of water, sunscreen, and insect repellent. Safety, above all, is non-negotiable. Always climb with a certified, experienced guide who knows the local routes and conditions.
