Every year, from June to December, the coastal town of <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/hermanus-experiences/">Hermanus</a> becomes a whale-watching hotspot. This is because southern right whales migrate to the area to calve and nurse their young. Consequently, you can witness these majestic creatures breaching the waters and showcasing their playful antics.</p>
<p>Moreover, the best viewpoints are easily accessible along the coast, allowing you to enjoy this spectacle without needing a boat. The <strong>Cliff Path</strong> is particularly popular for viewing. However, if you’re looking for a closer experience, consider booking a boat tour. Not only will you increase your chances of an up-close encounter, but you might also see dolphins and seals along the way. <em>Don’t forget your camera!</em></p>
