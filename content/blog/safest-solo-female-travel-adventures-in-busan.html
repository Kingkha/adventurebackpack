<p>While Busan is incredibly safe, smart travel practices enhance any solo journey. Always inform someone of your itinerary, even if it&#8217;s just a trusted friend back home. Utilize navigation apps like Naver Maps or KakaoMap for public transport and directions, as they are more accurate than Google Maps in Korea. Carry a portable charger, especially if you plan extensive outdoor activities, and ensure your phone is fully charged. When I travel, I always have a local SIM card; it&#8217;s inexpensive and crucial for emergencies or just looking up bus routes. Furthermore, research your accommodations, perhaps considering <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/best-hostels-for-backpackers-in-busan-south-korea">best hostels for backpackers in Busan, South Korea</a>, known for their communal atmosphere.
