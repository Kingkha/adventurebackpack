<p>When it comes to pure, unadulterated thrills, few things beat launching yourself from a plane or a towering crane. Skydiving in Pattaya offers breathtaking panoramic views of the coastline as you freefall from thousands of feet. It’s an incredible rush and an absolute must for any adrenaline junkie seeking extreme experiences. For a different kind of freefall, bungee jumping provides a massive adrenaline spike without the altitude sickness.
