<p>Before you dive fork-first into the culinary landscape, setting your expectations is key. An <strong>authentic street food tour Vigan for adventurous eaters</strong> isn&#8217;t just about the famous Vigan Longganisa or Empanada – it’s about discovering the lesser-known, often bolder, flavors that truly define local palates.

Look for vendors with bustling lines of locals, a sure sign of deliciousness and freshness. Preparing your palate means being ready for unique spice levels, sour notes, and occasionally, intriguing textures that might challenge but ultimately reward your adventurous spirit.</p>
