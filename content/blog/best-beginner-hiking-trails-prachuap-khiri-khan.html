<h2>Must-Try Beginner Hiking Trails in Prachuap Khiri Khan</h2>
<p>When it comes to the <strong>best beginner hiking trails Prachuap Khiri Khan</strong> presents, two spots truly stand out for their accessibility and rewarding views. First, there&#8217;s Khao Lom Muak, often called &#8216;Monkey Mountain,&#8217; near the city center. This isn&#8217;t a long hike, but the climb to the top, while steep in parts, is short and manageable for most, offering panoramic coastal views. Secondly, within the famous Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, you&#8217;ll find easier paths like the boardwalk leading through the wetlands or the more famous trek to Phraya Nakhon Cave. While the cave hike involves a bit of an uphill climb and stairs, it’s short and well-maintained, making it a popular choice for adventurers.
