<h2>Top Trails for Panoramic Vistas Around Beppu</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding the best hiking trails near Beppu for scenic views, two mountains immediately spring to mind: Mount Tsurumi and Mount Yufu. Mount Tsurumi, easily accessible via ropeway for a head start, offers sweeping panoramic vistas of the entire Beppu Bay and beyond. From its summit, I once witnessed a sunrise that painted the entire Oita coastline in hues of orange and pink – truly breathtaking! For a more challenging volcanic trek, Mount Yufu, often called &#8216;Bungofuji&#8217; due to its graceful twin peaks, provides a rewarding climb with equally stunning views of the surrounding countryside. Even easier routes like those around Kijima Kogen offer pleasant nature walks with lovely outlooks, perfect for a relaxed day out.</p>
