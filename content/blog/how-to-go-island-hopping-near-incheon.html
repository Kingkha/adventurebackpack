<p>Embarking on your island hopping journey starts with understanding the ferry system. Most ferries depart from the Incheon Coastal Passenger Terminal, distinct from the International Passenger Terminal. It’s crucial to check schedules in advance, especially since they can vary seasonally or due to weather. Personally, I always arrive at least 30 minutes early to grab tickets and find my gate without stress. Popular island destinations like Ganghwado, Muuido, and Yeongjongdo are easily accessible, with frequent services.
