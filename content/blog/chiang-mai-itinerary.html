<li><strong>Spending Time with the Elephants:</strong> Give them gentle scrubs while they lie in the mud or dust; this is vital for their skin health and a delightful way to bond with these gentle giants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concluding the Sanctuary Visit</h3>
<p>After a day filled with meaningful interactions and learning, take a moment to reflect on the importance of conservation and ethical tourism. Supporting these sanctuaries not only aids the elephants but also helps to fund vital restoration projects in their native habitats.</p>
<p>When your time at the sanctuary comes to an end, you will return to Chiang Mai enriched by a deeper understanding of these magnificent creatures and the challenges they face.</p>
<h3>What to Bring</h3>
<p>As you prepare for your day at the elephant sanctuary, consider packing the following:</p>
<ul>
