<p>Gangneung&#8217;s breathtaking coastline is your playground, and thankfully, it’s completely free to explore! You can spend hours simply strolling along the sandy shores of Anmok Beach or Jeongdongjin, soaking in the panoramic ocean views. For a bit more pace, renting a bicycle is a fantastic, low-cost way to cover more ground. I always recommend cycling the scenic coastal path, which offers stunning vistas and a refreshing breeze, making for perfect budget <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/gangneung-adventures">adventure activities</a> in Gangneung.
