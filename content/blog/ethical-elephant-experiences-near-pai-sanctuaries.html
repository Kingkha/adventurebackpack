<p>When planning your visit, it’s crucial to understand what ‘ethical’ truly means for elephant encounters. An ethical elephant experience focuses on the well-being of the elephants above all else, moving away from exploitative practices like riding or circus-style performances. In Pai, this translates to sanctuaries where elephants roam freely, socialize naturally, and are rescued from abusive situations. I&#8217;ve personally seen the stark difference between facilities, and supporting those that prioritize rehabilitation and natural behavior is key. Look for places that educate visitors on elephant conservation and the challenges these majestic creatures face, offering genuine cultural immersion into their care.</p>
