<p>Your Honda Bay snorkeling adventure typically kicks off from Sta. Lourdes Wharf, just a short drive from Puerto Princesa City.

<h2>Top Underwater Paradises: Islands for Snorkeling</h2>
<p>Honda Bay truly shines with its diverse snorkeling spots, each promising a unique encounter with Palawan’s aquatic biodiversity. Starfish Island, as its name suggests, is teeming with various starfish species – a delight for any visitor. Luli Island, which appears and disappears with the tides (hence &#8216;Lu-li&#8217; for &#8216;Lulubog-Lilitaw&#8217; or &#8216;sink-float&#8217;), offers excellent shallow areas perfect for spotting vibrant fish.

<p>Preparation is key for a seamless Honda Bay snorkeling trip. While gear rentals are available at the wharf, I always recommend bringing your own mask and snorkel if you have them, ensuring a comfortable fit.
