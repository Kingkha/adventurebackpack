From Hakata Station in Fukuoka, your journey typically involves a few transfers. First, hop on the JR Kagoshima Line bound for Kokura. Once at Kokura Station, transfer to the JR Nippo Line towards Yanagigaura and ride it to Saikai Station. From Saikai, the key is the JR Hita-Hikosan Line (which operates as the BRT Hiko-Yamabiko Line due to previous flood damage), taking you directly to Hiko-san Station or Hiko-san Entrance stop, right near the trailhead. This option is fantastic for solo travelers, allowing you to relax and enjoy the scenic route, often revealing hidden nature spots you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see.</p>
