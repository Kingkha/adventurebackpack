<p>One of my top pieces of advice for solo female travelers in Gyeongju is to trust your instincts, though thankfully, Gyeongju is remarkably safe. South Korea generally boasts low crime rates, and Gyeongju is no exception, making it perfect for solo exploration. Always opt for well-lit streets at night, and consider sharing your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member back home. For getting around, stick to reputable transportation like Kakao T for taxis or the efficient local bus system. When exploring new areas, keep your phone charged and download offline maps.

<h2>Thrilling Outdoors: Gyeongju&#8217;s Adventure Playground</h2>
<p>Gyeongju is an outdoor enthusiast&#8217;s dream, offering a fantastic array of activities for the solo female adventurer. Embrace the challenge of hiking Namsan Mountain, a vast open-air museum dotted with ancient Buddhist relics, or explore the expansive Gyeongju National Park. I highly recommend packing sturdy shoes for these excursions! For a more relaxed pace, rent a bicycle and pedal through the UNESCO World Heritage sites like Tumuli Park and around Bomun Lake. You can find detailed information on getting around by bike in my guide on <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/how-to-rent-a-bicycle-gyeongju-exploring">how to rent a bicycle Gyeongju exploring</a> options.

<p>Beyond the trails, Gyeongju offers incredible opportunities for cultural immersion that truly resonate with the independent spirit. Dedicate a day to exploring the iconic Bulguksa Temple and Seokguram Grotto, both masterpieces of Silla Buddhist art. Wandering through the ancient royal tombs at Tumuli Park or enjoying the serene beauty of Anapji Pond at night offers a profound connection to history. Don&#8217;t shy away from engaging with locals – a simple &#8216;Annyeonghaseyo&#8217; (hello) can open doors to unique interactions.
