While big-name outdoor shops might be scarce, local suppliers and even some hostels cater to the demand for budget-friendly rentals.

<p>Deciding what to rent versus what to purchase can significantly impact your budget when planning your Baguio trek. For most casual hikers, items like large backpacks (often called rucksacks), tents, cooking stoves, and sleeping bags are ideal for rental. These pieces of hiking equipment are bulky and can be expensive to buy outright, especially for a one-off trip. Conversely, I always recommend buying your own hiking boots or sturdy shoes, moisture-wicking socks, and personal essentials like a water bottle or headlamp. Comfort and hygiene are paramount, making personal footwear and clothing worth the investment. This helps streamline your <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/essential-packing-list-for-baguio-adventure-trip-in-rainy-season">essential packing list for Baguio adventure</a>.</p>
<h2>Rental Tips and Safety Considerations</h2>
<p>Once you’ve found where to rent affordable hiking gear in Baguio, Philippines, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure the quality and safety of your rented equipment. Always inspect gear thoroughly before leaving the shop. Check zippers on tents, straps on backpacks, and the overall integrity of any safety equipment like helmets or harnesses if you plan on more extreme activities. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask the rental provider for usage instructions, especially for unfamiliar items. Remember, even the most affordable gear needs to be in good working condition for your safety on the trails.
