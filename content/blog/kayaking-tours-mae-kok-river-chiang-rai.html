<p>Safety is paramount when embarking on any river journey. For your <strong>kayaking tours Mae Kok River Chiang Rai</strong>, always wear a properly fitted life jacket, even if you’re a strong swimmer. Light, quick-drying clothing, a hat, sunglasses, and plenty of reef-safe sunscreen are essential for sun protection. Remember to bring a waterproof bag for your phone, camera, and other valuables. Listen carefully to your guide&#8217;s instructions, especially regarding river conditions and any potential rapids, although the Mae Kok is generally calm. I always recommend carrying a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated, as the tropical climate can be deceiving.
