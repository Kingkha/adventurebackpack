<h1>Pha Taem National Park: Your Ubon Ratchathani Adventure Starts Here!</h1>
<p>Having explored Ubon Ratchathani extensively, I&#8217;ve found that planning ahead for national parks like Pha Taem is crucial for a smooth adventure. You&#8217;re likely wondering about the exact <strong>Pha Taem National Park entrance fee and hours</strong> before you even set foot near its ancient rock art and stunning Mekong views. Good news: Thailand&#8217;s national parks are generally budget-friendly for foreign visitors and offer consistent operating times. This guide will give you all the practical details you need, plus insights into maximizing your visit to this incredible natural landmark and other <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/ubon-ratchathani-adventures">Ubon Ratchathani adventures</a>.</p>


<h2>Unpacking Pha Taem National Park Entrance Fee and Hours</h2>
<p>Understanding the <strong>Pha Taem National Park entrance fee and hours</strong> is your first step to a hassle-free visit. Typically, the park opens daily from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. For foreign adults, the admission fee is usually 400 Thai Baht, while children are charged 200 Baht. Thai nationals pay a significantly lower rate, which is standard practice for national parks across the country. My personal tip: always carry small bills, as card payments aren&#8217;t always available at remote park entrances. It’s a small price for exploring ancient rock art, breathtaking cliff views, and the majestic Mekong River. Confirm current prices on arrival, as they can occasionally vary slightly, though the operating times are quite consistent.</p>

<p>Once you’ve sorted the entrance details, prepare to be amazed by Pha Taem&#8217;s unique natural and historical wonders. The park is renowned for its prehistoric cliff paintings, some dating back 3,000 to 4,000 years – a truly humbling experience. Beyond the ancient art, the panoramic views of the Mekong River valley, especially at sunrise, are absolutely spectacular. Many visitors make it a point to arrive early to witness this magical moment as the sun peeks over the Lao border.

Generally, the cool, dry season from November to February is ideal, with pleasant temperatures perfect for hiking and exploring.
