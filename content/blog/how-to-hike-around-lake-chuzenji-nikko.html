<h2>Popular Trails and Routes Around Chuzenji</h2>
<p>When planning how to hike around Lake Chuzenji Nikkō, you’ve got several fantastic options. The most popular choice is the scenic Lake Chuzenji Lakeside Walk, a relatively flat and accessible path that hugs parts of the lake. While a full loop around the entire lake (approx. 25km) is a substantial, long-distance hike for dedicated adventurers, many opt for shorter segments. My suggestion? Start near Chuzenji Onsen and head towards Tachiki Kannon Temple, then continue along the eastern shore. You’ll pass the iconic Futarasan Shrine, a significant <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/nikkō-landmarks">Nikkō landmark</a>.

<p>To truly enjoy your Lake Chuzenji Nikkō hike, proper preparation is key. Regardless of the season, sturdy, comfortable hiking shoes are non-negotiable – the trails can be uneven and rocky in places.
