<p>Before you dive headfirst into the excitement, a little prep goes a long way for your <strong>Mokpo backpacking adventure</strong>. First, aim to arrive by train or bus at Mokpo Station, the city&#8217;s main transport hub. It’s super convenient and puts you right in the heart of things. For accommodation, Mokpo offers fantastic value with cozy guesthouses and hostels, many designed with a backpacker&#8217;s budget in mind.

Pack light but wisely, focusing on versatile layers and sturdy walking shoes, ready for any spontaneous exploration in this coastal city.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Peaks, Views, and Historical Streets</h2>
<p>Kick off your <strong>Mokpo 3-day adventure itinerary</strong> with a bang at Yudalsan Mountain. This iconic peak offers spectacular panoramic views of the city, coastline, and islands. There are several trails, so pick one that suits your energy level – the climb is totally worth the reward! After descending, head straight for the Mokpo Marine Cable Car, one of the longest in South Korea, for an aerial perspective that truly captures the city’s stunning geography. I suggest going in the late afternoon to catch a magical sunset over the sea. Finally, wander through Mokpo Modern History Street, admiring the preserved Japanese colonial-era buildings. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the past and a great way to wind down after your outdoor activities, embracing the historical side of your Mokpo adventure.</p>
