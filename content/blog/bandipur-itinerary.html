Bandipur, located in the Western Ghats, has a humid subtropical climate with distinct seasons, each offering unique charm and opportunities for exploration.</p>
<h3>1. Winter Season (December to February)</h3>
<p>The winter months are perhaps the <strong>best time to visit Bandipur</strong>. The weather is cool and pleasant, with daytime temperatures averaging around <strong>20-25°C</strong> (68-77°F) and nighttime temperatures dipping to around <strong>10°C</strong> (50°F).

<h3>2. Summer Season (March to May)</h3>
<p>Summer brings warmer temperatures, often rising to <strong>30-35°C</strong> (86-95°F). Though the heat may seem intrusive, summer can still be a great time for wildlife enthusiasts as the dry conditions force animals to the waterholes, making them easier to spot.</p>

<h3>3. Monsoon Season (June to September)</h3>
<p>From June to September, the region receives heavy rainfall, transforming Bandipur into a lush green paradise. While this season rejuvenates the landscape, it can limit certain outdoor activities such as wildlife safaris and trekking due to slippery trails and safety concerns.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you appreciate misty landscapes and the calming sounds of rain, visiting during the monsoon can be a serene experience. Be sure to bring waterproof gear and check weather forecasts frequently.</p>
<h3>4. Post-Monsoon (October to November)</h3>
<p>Post-monsoon is another excellent time for a <strong>Bandipur itinerary</strong>. The weather is cooler and lush, making it ideal for photography and immersing yourself in nature. Wildlife activity peaks again as animals emerge after the rains, particularly from October onwards. Temperatures during this time typically range from <strong>15-25°C</strong> (59-77°F), providing a comfortable climate for outdoor adventures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> October is also the time for various local <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/bandipur-events/">festivals</a> which can enrich your cultural experience!</p>
