<h2>Navigating the Trails: Routes and Difficulty</h2>
<p>When planning your trekking Son Tra Peninsula trails Danang adventure, understanding the various routes is key. The peninsula offers a mix of paved roads (great for motorbiking) and unpaved, winding hiking paths that delve deep into the jungle.
