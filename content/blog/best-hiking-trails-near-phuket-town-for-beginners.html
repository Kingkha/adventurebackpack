<p>Just a short drive from central Phuket Town, Monkey Hill, or Toh Sae Hill, is another excellent option for those seeking beginner hiking trails.

This trail is popular with locals for exercise, offering a glimpse into everyday Phuket life. It’s a great choice if you want to combine some light exercise with wildlife observation.</p>
<h2>Big Buddha Trail: Spiritual Views with Accessible Options</h2>

Focus on the paved roads leading up, which are suitable for a leisurely trek with breathtaking panoramic views as your reward.
