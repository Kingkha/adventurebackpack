<p>Before you hit the road, proper preparation is key to a smooth motorbike adventure. First, secure a reliable rental bike; check brakes, tires, and lights thoroughly. Often, guesthouses or dedicated rental shops in town offer good options. I always recommend wearing a helmet, of course, but also sturdy closed-toe shoes and long sleeves to protect against sun and minor scrapes. Don&#8217;t forget rain gear—tropical downpours can be sudden!
