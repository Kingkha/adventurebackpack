<p>When planning your <strong>Kampala itinerary</strong>, understanding the best time to visit can enhance your travel experience significantly. The vibrant city experiences two major seasons: the dry season and the rainy season, each offering unique opportunities to explore Uganda’s capital.</p>
<h3>Dry Season: December to February &amp; June to August</h3>
<p>During the <strong>dry season</strong>, which spans from December to February and again from June to August, visitors enjoy warm, sunny weather, making it the ideal time for outdoor activities. The temperate climate and lower humidity levels provide a comfortable environment for sightseeing. This period is particularly popular among tourists, as many <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/kampala-landmarks-2/">attractions</a> are more accessible, and the wildlife in surrounding national parks is easier to spot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Events and <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/kampala-events-2/">festivals</a>:</strong> The annual <em>Kampala City Festival</em> usually takes place in early October, showcasing local culture, music, and crafts.

<li><strong>Wildlife Spotting:</strong> It is also noteworthy that certain wildlife, including migratory birds, can be seen more frequently during this time, appealing to birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel Considerations</h3>
<p>Regardless of the season you choose for your <strong>Kampala itinerary</strong>, it is essential to remain aware of local conditions and events that may impact your travel plans.
