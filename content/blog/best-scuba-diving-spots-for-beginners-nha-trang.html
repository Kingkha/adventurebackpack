As Vietnam&#8217;s first marine protected area, its waters are brimming with vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life, all easily accessible in shallow, gentle conditions. From colorful clownfish darting among anemones to graceful lionfish, the biodiversity here is simply breathtaking. I&#8217;ve personally seen countless first-time divers emerge from these waters with huge smiles, utterly enchanted by the underwater spectacle.
