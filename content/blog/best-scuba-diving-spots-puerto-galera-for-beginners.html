<div data-gyg-partner-id="26CH4CT" data-gyg-widget="auto" loading="lazy"></div>
<p>Safety is paramount for any diver, especially beginners. Always choose a reputable dive center with certified instructors and well-maintained equipment. Ask about their <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/how-much-do-puerto-galera-adventure-tours-cost">adventure tour costs</a>, which often reflect the quality and safety standards. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions and communicate any anxieties you might have. My personal tip: take your time equalizing your ears; never force it. Understanding basic hand signals before your dive is also crucial for clear communication underwater. Furthermore, engaging with <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/how-to-find-local-adventure-guides-puerto-galera">local <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/puerto-galera-adventures">adventure guides</a></a> can provide invaluable insights into the best practices and hidden gems.

<h2>Pre-Dive Prep &amp; What to Expect Underwater</h2>
