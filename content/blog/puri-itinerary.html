Inside the temple complex, you will encounter crowds of pilgrims as you absorb the spiritually charged atmosphere. The intricate carvings and vibrant paintings adorning the temple walls narrate various stories from Hindu mythology, providing you a glimpse into the culture and <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/puri-culture/">traditions</a> of the region.</p>
