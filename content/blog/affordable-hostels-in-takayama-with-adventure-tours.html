<p>Before hitting Takayama&#8217;s trails and rivers, ensure you&#8217;re properly equipped. While some hostels or tour operators might offer basic gear rentals, it&#8217;s wise to bring your own sturdy hiking boots, appropriate layering for changing mountain weather, and a good backpack. If you&#8217;re traveling light, you can easily find rental options. I once found myself needing a specific type of waterproof jacket, and the hostel staff pointed me to a fantastic local shop.
