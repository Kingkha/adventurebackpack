<h2>Best Time to Visit: Seasonal Insights for Your Bukit Lawang Itinerary</h2>
<p>Planning your <strong>Bukit Lawang itinerary</strong> requires careful consideration of the seasons, as they significantly affect weather, wildlife sightings, and overall experiences.

<h3>Wildlife Spotting</h3>
<p>The dry season not only boasts better weather conditions but also increases your chances of spotting wildlife, including the famous orangutans. Animals are generally more active during this time as they venture out in search of food. Early morning treks will often yield sightings of various species such as gibbons, macaques, and a plethora of bird species.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To see orangutans in their natural habitat is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, best enjoyed during the dry months when they are more visible.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Temperature and Conditions</h3>
<p>Temperature in Bukit Lawang varies from <strong>20°C to 30°C</strong> (68°F to 86°F) throughout the year, so dressing in lightweight, breathable clothing is essential.
