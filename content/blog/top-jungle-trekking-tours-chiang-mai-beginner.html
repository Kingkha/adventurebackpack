<p>Preparing for your first jungle trek doesn&#8217;t require a mountaineer&#8217;s kit, but a few key items will make all the difference. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes with good grip are paramount – think sneakers or light hiking boots, not flip-flops! Lightweight, breathable clothing that covers your arms and legs helps protect against sun and insects. Don&#8217;t forget a small backpack with water, sunscreen, insect repellent, and a hat. For myself, I’ve found that even on an easy trail, a good water bottle is an absolute hiking essential. Considering the weather is also crucial; check the <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/best-time-for-adventurous-travel-chiang-mai">best time for adventurous travel in Chiang Mai</a> to pack accordingly, especially during the rainy season.</p>
