<h2>Top Easy Hiking Trails for Beginners in Seoul</h2>
<p>When seeking the best easy hiking trails Seoul for beginners, a few stand out for their accessibility and gentle slopes. Ansan Jarak-gil Trail in Seodaemun-gu is a personal favorite, offering a flat, wooden deck path that circles Ansan Mountain, perfect for a leisurely walk with great views.
