<p>Finding a bike rental in Gangneung is thankfully straightforward, especially around popular tourist hubs. My go-to spots for a bicycle rental in Gangneung are usually near Gyeongpo Lake or Anmok Beach. These areas boast numerous small shops where you can easily pick up a set of wheels. For instance, right by Gyeongpo Lake, you&#8217;ll see several options offering various types of bikes, from tandem bikes perfect for couples to electric ones for those who prefer less effort. These spots are fantastic starting points for your <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/gangneung-adventures">Gangneung adventures</a>. Look out for signboards advertising &#8220;자전거 대여&#8221; (jajeongeo daeyeo), which means bicycle rental.

<p>Renting a bike on the Gangneung coastal path is quite affordable, making it a fantastic <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/budget-adventure-activities-gangneung-south-korea">budget-friendly adventure</a>. Typically, a standard bicycle will cost around 5,000-10,000 KRW per hour, or 15,000-25,000 KRW for a half-day or full-day rental. Electric bikes might be slightly more.

It stretches for miles, offering breathtaking ocean vistas and connecting several popular beaches.
