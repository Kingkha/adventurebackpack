Although many consider this season <strong>less suitable for extensive tourism</strong>, witnessing the city bathed in rain can be a unique cultural experience.</p>
<p>During the monsoon, traditional <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/kolkata-calcutta-events/">festivals</a> such as <strong>Durga Puja</strong> kick off, attracting visitors from around the country and beyond.
