<p>Embarking on your journey to the Gigantes Islands is the first thrilling step. From Iloilo City, youâ€™ll typically head to Carles or Estancia port, then hop on a public boat or arrange a private transfer. Having done this multiple times, I always recommend booking your transport in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid any last-minute hitches. The boat ride itself is an experience, offering stunning views of the Visayan Sea and the anticipation of island exploration. Once you arrive at Gigantes Norte or Sur, local guides and boats are readily available to ferry you to the various island hopping destinations, including the one leading to Pawikan Cave.

<h2>Inside Pawikan Cave: Your Exploration Guide</h2>
<p>Now for the main event: how to explore Pawikan Cave Gigantes Islands Iloilo! This cave, also known as Bakwitan Cave by some locals, isn&#8217;t just about stalactites and stalagmites; it holds intriguing historical significance with its pottery fragments and ancient burial sites. You&#8217;ll need a local guide, which is usually part of any island hopping package. My first tip: wear sturdy sandals or water shoes with good grip. The cave floor can be uneven and occasionally damp. The exploration involves a mix of walking, ducking through narrower passages, and a bit of scrambling. Guides will point out the famous rock formations and the areas where turtle eggs are believed to have been laid.

<p>Safety is paramount when embarking on any adventure, especially when delving into caves. For Pawikan Cave, a headlamp or a good flashlight is non-negotiable; while guides often have one, having your own ensures clarity and independence.

<p>Budget-friendly adventure options abound in Gigantes. While island hopping tours have a standard rate, you can save by traveling in a group to split boat costs. Negotiating respectfully with local boatmen is also common practice. From my own backpacking experiences across the Philippines, the best time to visit Gigantes Islands, including exploring Pawikan Cave, is during the dry season, from November to May. The seas are calmer, making boat travel smoother and visibility better for cave exploration. Avoid the peak typhoon season from June to October.
