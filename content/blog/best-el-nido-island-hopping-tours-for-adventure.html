<p>When it comes to pure adrenaline, the island hopping tours in El Nido truly deliver. While Tour A and C are popular, certain stops on these circuits, like exploring Secret Lagoon (Tour A) or navigating the tight entrance to Matinloc Shrine&#8217;s hidden beach (Tour C), offer incredible adventure. For backpackers and thrill-seekers, opting for a private tour allows you to customize and spend more time kayaking into tight crevices or cliff jumping where permitted. From my experience, the journey through Big Lagoon on a kayak is unparalleled, offering a truly immersive way to discover the <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/how-to-find-hidden-lagoons-el-nido">hidden lagoons El Nido</a> boasts.
