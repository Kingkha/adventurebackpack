Venture beyond Ben Thanh Market&#8217;s main entrance into its surrounding perimeter streets, especially after sunset. Here, the aroma of grilled meats and fresh herbs fills the air as pop-up food stalls materialize, offering classics like <em>Bún Chả</em> (grilled pork with noodles) and savory Vietnamese pancakes (<em>Bánh Xèo</em>). It&#8217;s a fantastic place to ease into the street food scene, observing the lively culinary dance of vendors and locals. Always look for crowds; that&#8217;s your sign of truly good food!</p>
