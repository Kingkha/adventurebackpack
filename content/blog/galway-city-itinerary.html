The weather during this period is often mild and pleasant, making it ideal for outdoor <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/galway-city-adventures/">explorations</a> and festivals.</p>
<p>In <strong>summer</strong>, Galway comes alive with an array of vibrant <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/galway-city-events/">festivals</a>, including the renowned <em>Galway International Arts Festival</em> in July, where street performances, theater productions, and music <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/galway-city-events/">Events</a> fill the air with creativity.
