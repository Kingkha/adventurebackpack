<p>When planning your trip to find the best hiking trails near Matsumoto Japan, Kamikochi and Norikura Kogen should be at the top of your list. Kamikochi, often called the &#8220;Jewel of the Japan Alps,&#8221; is a pristine valley offering trails suitable for all levels, from leisurely riverside strolls along the Azusa River to challenging ascents up Hotaka-dake. It truly feels like stepping into a postcard, a perfect gateway for anyone seeking grand alpine vistas. My top tip: arrive early to beat the crowds and enjoy the tranquil morning mist. Norikura Kogen, another incredible alpine playground, provides accessible trails even higher up, often with snow lingering well into summer, and boasts stunning caldera lakes. You can even take a bus almost to the summit for an easy start to a high-altitude trek.</p>
