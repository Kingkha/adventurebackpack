<p>When it comes to exploring the hiking trails Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park presents, two stand out as absolute must-dos for any adventure traveler.

From my experience, the journey through rugged terrain and steep steps is totally worth it for that magical morning light hitting the pavilion. Another fantastic option is the Khao Daeng Viewpoint trail. This shorter, steeper climb offers panoramic vistas of the park&#8217;s limestone peaks and the Gulf of Thailand, especially stunning at sunrise or sunset.
