<p>Imagine a smooth path stretching 70 kilometers, seamlessly connecting islands with magnificent bridges over the azure Seto Inland Sea. That’s the magic of the Shimanami Kaido, truly one of Japan&#8217;s most celebrated cycling adventures. It’s uniquely designed with dedicated bike lanes, making it incredibly safe and accessible for all skill levels. You’ll traverse six distinct islands—Mukaishima, Innoshima, Ikuchijima, Omishima, Hakatajima, and Oshima—each with its own charm and stunning viewpoints. My favorite part is feeling the sea breeze as I cycle across those colossal bridges; it&#8217;s an unparalleled sensation. This route offers an incredible blend of physical challenge and serene beauty, solidifying its reputation as a must-do for anyone exploring Hiroshima and beyond.</p>
<h2>Navigating the Best Cycling Routes on Shimanami Kaido</h2>
<p>While the full 70km Shimanami Kaido is the ultimate goal for many, there are fantastic options for every cyclist. You can start from Onomichi (Hiroshima Prefecture) or Imabari (Ehime Prefecture). For the full experience, consider a two-day trip, staying overnight on an island like Ikuchijima or Omishima. If time is tight, focus on a section; the stretch between Ikuchijima and Omishima is particularly scenic, offering a taste of the island-hopping adventure. I recommend grabbing a detailed map at the rental stations; it marks all the blue lines that guide you perfectly. Remember, the best cycling routes on Shimanami Kaido are marked with blue lines on the pavement, making navigation a breeze!</p>
