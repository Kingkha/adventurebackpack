<p>Embarking on <strong>Coron Town hidden hiking trails for explorers</strong> demands proper preparation. Unlike paved paths, these routes can be rugged, slippery, and overgrown. Always wear sturdy hiking shoes with good grip and bring plenty of water – more than you think you’ll need, especially on a hot day.
