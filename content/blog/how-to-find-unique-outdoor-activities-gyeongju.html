My best tip is to explore the lesser-known trails within Gyeongju National Park; many offer breathtaking views without the crowds, perfect for a challenging hike or a peaceful nature walk.

Consider looking into local climbing spots or even exploring hidden waterfalls for an authentic Gyeongju adventure.</p>
<h2>Actively Explore Gyeongju&#8217;s Rich Culture</h2>
