<h2>Timing Your Eco-Adventure: Seasons and Festivals</h2>
<div data-gyg-partner-id="26CH4CT" data-gyg-widget="auto" loading="lazy"></div>
<p>Knowing the best time to visit Iloilo can significantly enhance your eco-friendly adventure activities. The dry season (November to May) offers ideal conditions for island hopping and hiking, with clearer skies and calmer seas. This is also when many vibrant <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/iloilo-events">Iloilo events</a> and festivals take place, allowing for cultural immersion. However, the rainy season (June to October) has its own charm, with lush green landscapes and fewer tourists, making it perfect for those seeking solitude and a deeper connection with nature, though some activities might be weather-dependent. Planning your trip around these seasons can optimize your experience. For example, if you&#8217;re planning to <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/how-to-get-to-gigantes-islands-from-iloilo">get to Gigantes Islands from Iloilo</a>, consider traveling during the dry months for smoother boat rides. My personal recommendation: aim for the shoulder months (late May or early November) to enjoy good weather with fewer crowds.</p>
