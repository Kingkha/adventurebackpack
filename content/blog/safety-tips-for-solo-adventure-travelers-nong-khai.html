<p>Even as a solo traveler, you&#8217;re not entirely alone. Share your itinerary with a trusted friend or family back home before each new leg. Consider investing in a local SIM card to stay connected. While meeting new people is great, exercise caution; avoid sharing too much personal information immediately. Always trust your instincts; if a situation feels off, politely excuse yourself. My personal rule of thumb in places like Nong Khai is to connect with hostel staff or fellow travelers, and sharing your rough <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/nong-khai-adventure-itinerary-for-backpackers-3-days">Nong Khai adventure itinerary</a> adds reassurance.</p>
