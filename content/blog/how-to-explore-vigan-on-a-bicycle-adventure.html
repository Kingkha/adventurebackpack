<h2>Pedaling Through History: Essential Vigan Cycling Routes</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;re geared up, it&#8217;s time to hit the road! To truly explore Vigan on a bicycle adventure, begin with the iconic Calle Crisologo, ideally in the early morning before the crowds. From there, branch out to other significant <a href="https://adventurebackpack.com/vigan-landmarks">Vigan landmarks</a> like the Bantay Bell Tower, Plaza Salcedo, and St. Paul Metropolitan Cathedral. A favorite route of mine involves a loop that extends to the Syquia Mansion, offering a glimpse into Vigan&#8217;s affluent past.
