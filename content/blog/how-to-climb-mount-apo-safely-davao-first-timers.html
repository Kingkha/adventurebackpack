Focus on cardio exercises like running, swimming, or cycling, and incorporate strength training, especially for your legs and core. Don&#8217;t forget practice hikes with a loaded backpack! Mentally, prepare for changing weather, long trekking hours, and basic facilities. A positive attitude and resilience are your secret weapons.
