<p>Beyond Vigan&#8217;s iconic colonial architecture, a world of natural thrills awaits adventure enthusiasts. Forget the crowded tourist spots; instead, venture towards the Bantay Bell Tower area where you can find paths leading to less-trodden riverside views. My favorite discovery was the less-talked-about side trails near the Abra River, perfect for a quiet morning jog or some peaceful birdwatching. For true outdoor activities, head slightly outside the city center to explore the local farmlands on a mountain bike, which offers a unique perspective of rural Ilocos Sur.

<p>Embarking on an adventure in Vigan requires a bit of savvy planning to ensure both safety and enjoyment. Always inform your hostel or a friend about your itinerary, especially if you&#8217;re exploring off-grid paths. For solo female travelers, my personal tip is to always carry a small flashlight, even during the day, for unexpected dark alleys or power outages. Vigan is generally safe, but common sense prevails. To keep your exploration budget-friendly, prioritize local eateries over tourist traps and opt for public transport like tricycles or even bicycles instead of private hires.

Don&#8217;t forget sunscreen, insect repellent, and a reusable water bottle – staying hydrated is crucial in the tropical heat.
