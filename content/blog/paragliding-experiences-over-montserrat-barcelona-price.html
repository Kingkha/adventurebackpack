As an avid hiker, I&#8217;ve spent many hours exploring these trails – a perfect complement to a morning flight. Consider combining your paragliding with a visit to the monastery or a scenic hike.

<div data-gyg-partner-id="26CH4CT" data-gyg-widget="auto" loading="lazy"></div>
<p>To make the most of your paragliding experience, come prepared! Wear comfortable clothing suitable for the weather, ideally layers, and sturdy closed-toe shoes (trainers or light hiking boots are perfect). Sunglasses are a must, and avoid anything that could easily fall out of your pockets. Your pilot will provide a thorough briefing on takeoff and landing procedures, so listen carefully and follow their instructions. They&#8217;ll strap you into a harness, check all connections, and then it&#8217;s a short run before you&#8217;re airborne!
