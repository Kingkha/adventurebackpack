<p>When planning your trip to Fukuoka for invigorating outdoor activities, spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) truly stand out as the ideal seasons. The weather during these periods is incredibly mild, offering comfortable temperatures perfect for extensive exploration. Picture yourself hiking through vibrant cherry blossoms in spring or admiring the fiery red and gold foliage of autumn, especially around places like Mount Hiko.
